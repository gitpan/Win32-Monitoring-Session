=head1 NAME

Win32::Monitoring::Session - Get information on the logon session

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Win32::Monitoring::Session qw(GetLogonSessionData GetLogonSessionId);
   my $sessionid = GetLogonSessionId($$);
   my $info = GetLogonSessionData($sessionid);
   print "Logon Time: ".localtime($info->{LogonTime});

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Win32::Monitoring::Session module provides an interface to query Windows
for additional session information. Most notably the exact logon time which
seems to be rather difficult to get a hold of more or less portable way.

Note that windows seems to treat this kind of information as privileged. As
a normal user you can only get information about your own processes and your
own session. Admin will be better of in this respect.

=over

=item $sessionid=GetLogonSessionId($pid)

Returns the LogonSessionId for the process id specified in the argument.

=item $info_ptr=GetLogonSessionData($sessionid)

Ask the security subsystem for additional information about the
given logon session. The information is returned via hash pointer.
If there was a problem, there will be a special 'ERROR' and 'ERRORCODE' entries in the hash.
The following keys are returned if there is appropriate information available.

 UserName
 LogonDomain
 AuthenticationPackage 
 LogonTime (seconds since 1970 unix time format)
